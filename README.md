**Mastodon_NetMod** is an under-development Python toolkit for working with [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) network moderation data.
It leverages the [Official Mastodon APIs](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/) to provide easy-to-use access to publicly available Mastodon network moderation events.

**Mastodon_NetMod** only relies on the *publicly accessible* endpoints from Mastodon and does not require any authentication to access public data.

**Mastodon_NetMod** is a work-in-progress toolkit, that currently supports the following operations:
- [x]   Fetching of currently online Mastodon instances from the instances.social platform
- [X]   Collection of network moderation events (i.e., blocks) among Mastodon instances
- [x]   Export into DBs of the collected events

---

### How to use?
- Obtain a token from the [instances.social](https://instances.social/api/token) platform to access the list of tracked instances
- Update the *config.json* file according to your information
- Run and enjoy! :)
